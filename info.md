# Home Assistant IHC Viewer

This is a IHC viewer custom component for Home Assistant.

NOTE: Version 2.x requires the new IHC integration - [Read about it here](https://www.dingus.dk/help-testing-the-new-home-assistant-ihc-integration/)
If you have the build in IHC integration in Home Assistant - you should not update IHCViewer.

[Read more about on my blog here](https://www.dingus.dk/ihc-viewer-for-home-assistant/)

To use it go to Configuration|Integrations and click the add integration. Find the IHCViwer in the list.

And you MUST have [IHC configured in Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ihc/).
