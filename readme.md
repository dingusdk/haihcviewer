# Home Assistant IHC Viewer

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

This is a IHC viewer custom component for Home Assistant.

[Read more about on my blog here](https://www.dingus.dk/ihc-viewer-for-home-assistant/)

To use it, the easist way is to install it with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz). Add this repo as a Custom Repository in HACS and install it.

Without HACS you will have to place the custom_components folder in your HA configuration folder.

Either way, in the configuration.yaml file insert this:

```yaml
ihcviewer:
```

And you MUST have [IHC configured in Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ihc/).

You will get a new menu item:

And you can view your IHC project:

Use IHC Viewer to get IHC resource ids to be used for manual setup or the ihc service functions.
